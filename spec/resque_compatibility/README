This is a port of existing Resque tests to RSpec with minor modifications for
the purpose of ensuring that Dagque objects which subclass Resque objects
maintain API compatibility.

We are especially interested in ensuing that the Dagqueue worker is compatible
with Resque jobs and queues and can be used for both.

No attempt is made for Dagqueue to work with the existing Rake tasks. Dagqueue
ships with its own scripts for running the Dagqueue workers daemonized.
